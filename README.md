#Fully Automated Voice Search

This is a project that lets you search the internet with only voice commands. Each command is transcripted using OpenAI's Whisper API and then fed into Browserbase's Stagehand framework. There is no intermediary processing; to optimize for speed,users' prompts are fed directly into Stagehand's framework. Hopefully, this makes the internet a more accessible place to be.
